    there is not much that i could do today since we are going to have a party for labor day. 

    i decided that i wanted to orgnize all of the componenets including the root into seperate folders to make it easier to understand and look at. 

    it took me a little work to remeber where everything wires up to but for the most part it was not that big of a deal. 

    created the shell for adding in the login componenet
